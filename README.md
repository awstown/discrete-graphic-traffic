### How to use discrete-graphic-traffic

1. Use the GUI: 

After cloning or downloading the current source files cd into the discrete-graphic traffic folder and run the following:

<code>
python multiple_car.py
</code>

This will open the GUI and you will have an intuitive and visual way to manipulate parameters.

2. Using the classes in your own project: We have created to classes(Lane, Car) as well as a Rules module.
