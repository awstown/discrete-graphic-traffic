# Discrete Traffic Flow with Graphical Representation

## Roles
These are tentantive.
- Project Manager = Dwight Townsend
- Visualizations  = Josh Fernandes
- Objects         = Andrew Parker
- Rules           = Ray Mullen

## Project Plan

### Parameters
-velocity

-position


### Step 1: A single car looping on a single lane road of length, L.
*Assigned:* Andrew Parker (_However, we are all attempting this individually to get an idea of the project in our heads_)

**Concept:**

1. Classes
  1. Car - Will contain a varibles for a car object (e.g. Location, velocity, and potentially rules for acceleration)
  2. Lane/Road - Will contain a list containing all the cars currently on the road. Methods for adding/removing cars,
               or possibly a the rules for acceleration of the cars. It will have length varible and have which will
               represent the number of discrete steps.
